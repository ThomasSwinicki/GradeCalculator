# GradeCalculator

Simple Calculator I am creating with Java Swing GUI to get practice in GUI and later be able to use locally for quick calculations of 
personal grades from school.

Will mimic a similar format to that of the Ben Eggleston grade calculator found at www.benegg.net/grade_calculator.html.

Desires features in final program:
-5 inputs for grades and their respective percentages
-button to add more inputs for more grades if necessary
-calculation of grade needed to get with remaining perventage to achieve a specific grade, which is set by the user by an input
-calculation of final grade received based on an arbitrary grade the user inputs as the grade used for the remaining percentages
